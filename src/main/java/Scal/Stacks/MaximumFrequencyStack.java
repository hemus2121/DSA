Problem Description

You are given a matrix A which represent operations of size N x 2. Assume initially you have a stack-like data structure you have to perform operations on it.
Operations are of two types:

1 x: push an integer x onto the stack and return -1
2 0: remove and return the most frequent element in the stack.
If there is a tie for the most frequent element, the element closest to the top of the stack is removed and returned.

A[i][0] describes the type of operation to be performed. A[i][1] describe the element x or 0 corresponding to the operation performed.
